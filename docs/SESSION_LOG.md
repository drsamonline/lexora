# LEXORA Session Log

Append-only, dated session summaries. Never rewrite history; append a correction entry instead (mark it `CORRECTION`).

## 2026-10-15 — Session 1: Repository & documentation audit

- **Objective:** Inspect repository; produce audit, prioritized documentation plan, and open-decision list before creating any files (master prompt §2).
- **Actions:** Verified branch/commit (`main`, `816f58f`), working tree state, tracked files. Read the blueprint in full. Identified four internal blueprint conflicts and missing project decisions.
- **Files changed:** None.
- **Commands run:** `git status`, `git log`, directory listing/inspection of `/workspace`.
- **Outcomes:** Audit + 4-batch documentation plan delivered to owner. Confirmed: no code, tests, CI, license, or benchmark artifacts exist.
- **Decisions:** None formalized (no ADRs yet). Conflicts logged for later OQ entries.
- **Failures/blockers:** Owner input needed on gate scope, baseline roles, cleaning metric, license, repo URL, Python version, corpus.
- **Next action:** On approval, create Batch A governance documents.

## 2026-10-15 — Session 2: Batch A — governance & navigation documents

- **Objective:** Owner said "start batch a". Create the Batch A file set honestly reflecting zero implementation status.
- **Pre-state verified:** `git status --short` clean; HEAD `816f58f`; only the blueprint file existed. Created dirs `docs/ADR`, `docs/templates`.
- **Actions / files created (19 total):**
  - Root: `README.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`, `.editorconfig`, `.gitattributes`, `.gitignore`
  - `docs/`: `index.md`, `STATUS.md`, `PROGRESS.md`, `SESSION_LOG.md` (this file), `NEXT_SESSION.md`, `PROJECT_CHARTER.md`, `PRODUCT_REQUIREMENTS.md`, `GLOSSARY.md`, `DECISIONS.md`
  - `docs/ADR/`: `README.md`, `ADR-0001-template.md`
  - `docs/templates/`: `SESSION_NOTE_TEMPLATE.md`, `ADR_TEMPLATE.md`
- **Key content choices:**
  - No badges added anywhere (no remote/CI/license evidence) — README uses a neutral "Project status: In development" notice instead.
  - Blueprint conflicts formalized as open questions **OQ-1…OQ-10** in `docs/DECISIONS.md` (gate scope; Brotli role; PPMd role; cleaning-error metric; license; repo URL; Python version; corpus; versioning adoption; OCR stack).
  - Requirements given IDs/priorities/verification methods (`REQ-ING/CAN/CMP/EXP/FMT/BMK/RES/SEC-*`); all statuses "Not started"; REQ-CAN-007 marked Blocked on OQ-4.
  - Deliberately did NOT create placeholder docs from the master tree that would be empty or misleading (USER_GUIDE, CLI_REFERENCE, FORMAT_*, SECURITY_*, CONTRIBUTING, CODE_OF_CONDUCT, LICENSE, CITATION.cff, FUNDING.yml, workflows, diagrams) — deferred to Batches B–E with real content.
- **Commands run & results:** `git status --short` (clean pre-state), `git log --oneline -3`, `ls -la`, `mkdir -p docs/ADR docs/templates`, `git rev-parse --short HEAD` → `816f58f`, `date +%F` → 2026-10-15; hygiene files written via `printf` (exit 0); link-check script → initially 1 broken link (`docs/index.md → DEVELOPMENT_SETUP.md`), fixed by de-linking the planned file, re-run → **ALL LINKS OK**; badge grep (`img.shields|actions/workflows`) → only a self-referential mention inside NEXT_SESSION instructions, no actual badges.
- **Test outcomes:** No test suite exists; nothing runnable. Validation limited to manual link review of created files.
- **Decisions made:** None accepted; this session only *documents* decision needs.
- **Known gaps:** All planned Batch B–E documents; ADR drafting for OQ-1…OQ-4; commit checkpoint pending owner workflow permission.
- **Next action:** Commit Batch A (pending owner workflow confirmation), then await owner answers to OQ-1…OQ-10 before drafting Batch B normative spec. Link validation is complete (see commands above).
